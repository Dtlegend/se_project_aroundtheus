# David Thompson Project 3: Around The U.S.

My Traveler's Profile project aims to provide users with an interactive platform to explore the traveler's adventures around the world. It features a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It was a great project to introduce me to responsive design and grid layouts.

* Responsive Design: Ensured the project is accessible and user-friendly across different devices and   screen sizes.
 * Google Fonts Integration: I used Google Fonts to enhance typography and improve readability.
