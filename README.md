My Traveler's Profile project aims to provide users with an interactive platform to explore the traveler's adventures around the world. It features a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It was a great project to introduce me to responsive design and grid layouts.
